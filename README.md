# Spring 4.3 Ivy Demo

This simple demo shows how to add Spring 4.3 dependencies to an Ant/Ivy project. 

To get started, run the following:
```
â†’ ant -lib lib/ run
```

... and you should see the following:
```
Buildfile: /Users/demo/spring4-ivy/build.xml

BUILD SUCCESSFUL
Total time: 1 second
```


**Note:** The `[java] Start it up!` line is the actual main method of our example application. While it doesn't (_yet_) 
actually launch a Spring application, it will indeed fail if the dependencies are not resolved in your `lib/` directory.

## Next Steps

Check out the `nesification` branch to see how easy it is to start using HeroDevs' NES for Spring packages.
